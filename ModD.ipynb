        "Linear algebra is one of the most important fields of math within computing.  At the core of linear algebra are matrices.  They are used to represent linear systems.  Here, linear means the variables are only multiplied by constants and added together, with no exponents or special functions.\n",

        "Before linear algebra, we discuss set theory.  In mathematics, a set is just a group of objects.  Usually order does not matter and there's no repetition.  All that matters is whether something is in the set or out of the set.  Sets can contain anything, but the simplest example is sets of numbers.\n",

        "We can talk about sets in the language of set theory.  You can take the union of 2 sets, so A U B contains everything that is in either A or B, or both.  You can take the intersection, so A ∩ B contains each element that is in both A and B.  You can also subtract sets.  A \\ B contains each element that is in A but not in B.  The ∈ symbol means \"in\".  The colon : means \"such that\" so A = {b : b^2=1, b∈R} is a set that contains all real numbers whose square equals 1.  This is the same as {-1, 1}.  There is also the empty set with no elements in it {}.\n",

Elements of this set are n dimensional vectors.  An example of a 3 dimensional vector is [1, 3, -4].  It is written as a row vector, but there ae also column vectors.  You can convert between these with the transpose operation (^T).  The norm of a vector v is denoted ||v|| and is simply the square root of the sum of the squares of each part of v.  When dealing with vectors, regular numbers are called scalars.\n",

You can multiply a vector by a scalar, for example 3x = [3a, 3b, 3c].  Multiplying 2 vectors has several versions.  The dot product is just the scalar x⋅y = ad+be+cf.  The cross product is the vector x×y = [bf-ce, cd-af, ae-bd].  The dot product and cross product both have formulas relating to the angle between the vectors (this only makes sense when we think of vectors as arrows pointing to points in space denoted by the coordinates of the vector).\n",

Matrix multiplication is where it gets really interesting.  First of all, order matters, so A\\*B is not the same as B\\*A.  If A has x rows and y columns, and B has z rows and w columns, A\\*B is only possible if the y = z.  The resulting product will be a matrix with x rows and w columns.

You could also have something more complicated where the input is a vector v = [x, y, z]^T and the output is also a vector.  F(v) = [ax+by+cz, dx+ey+fz, gx+hy+iz]^T.  In this case, the constants a to i can be arranged in a matrix A and then the function is equivalent to matrix vector multiplication F(v) = A*v.  This is an example of a linear transformation.  When we talk about linear transformations like this, we almost always use the matrix form.  The domain is the set of all possible inputs and in this case it's all of the 3 dimensional vector space.  The range is the set of all outputs given the domain as input.  It is often the same as the domain, but if the matrix has determinant 0, then the range will be lower dimensional compared to the domain.  So it's possible for a linear transformation to flatten 3d space into a plane, line, or even single point.

In Gaussian elimination, your goal is to create an upper triangular matrix, where the bottom left half (except the diagonal) is all 0s.  This makes it into a much simpler linear system of equations.
